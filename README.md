# MBTA-Web-App-Project

This is the base repository for Web App project. Please read the [instructions](instructions.md) for details.

## Project Writeup and Reflection
### Project Overview
This project focused on building a basic web application in Python using the Flask framework to help users find the nearest MBTA station to a place they enter. By using Mapbox and MBTA APIs, the app converts user input into coordinates and then returns the closest station name and whether it's wheelchair accessible. The main features include a form on the homepage for user input, a result page that shows the station information, and an error page if no results are found or if the user does not submit a valid input. Overall, the project aims to provide users with a simple way to access public transportation information.

### Reflection
The development process for this project was challenging but rewarding. Setting up the Flask framework was the most challenging part of the project since I had the least amount of experience with that framework. Aside from that, it took me a while to understand how to format the URLs properly and handle JSON responses. Debugging was pretty overwhelming because I struggle to troubleshoot errors especially when it comes to APIs since the traceback is more complex. Looking back, I think where I could've improved would have been paying closer attention to the attached documentation and taking my time to read up on the key topics for this project instead of just diving right in. For following projects, I want to focus more on the planning stage before jumping into implementation. 

Working on this project individually made it especially important to find solutions to problems on my own. Without a teammate to rely on, I often felt stuck when things didn’t go as planned, especially during the early stages as I was figuring out the proper structures to use for my code. To manage these challenges, I relied a lot on GenAI to troubleshoot is it was able to point out where specifically the error in my code were while providing different suggestions wwith explanations on how to resolve them. Despite feeling isolated in the process at times, I learned that breaking problems down into smaller parts and focusing on one step at a time helped me keep from getting overwhelmed. If I were to do this again, I’d make a habit of regularly checking in with an instructor or peer for advice so as to get different perspectives on the problem.

From a learning perspective, this project taught me a lot about handling APIs and using Flask to structure a basic web app. I realized that I still need more practice with Flask to feel confident building web apps, especially when it comes to debugging. Going forward, I want to improve my skills with error handling and testing in Flask, so I don’t rely so much on trial and error. I also think having a stronger understanding of API documentation and data handling would help me troubleshoot problems more independently in the future.
